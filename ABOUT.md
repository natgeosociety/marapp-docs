# About<br />
As we enter the fourth industrial revolution, technology is revolutionizing our ability to map nature. Satellite data provide a bird’s eye, yet incredibly detailed view of the Earth’s surface in real-time, while drones and mobile apps enable local communities and indigenous peoples to map their knowledge of local ecosystems. Spatial data empowers governments to make well-informed decisions to ensure that nature is not left behind in the information age. Through a partnership between the UNDP and UN Environment, the UN Biodiversity Lab will work closely with national governments to provide every country with the best available spatial data to make informed conservation decisions.
